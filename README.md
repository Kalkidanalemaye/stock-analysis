# Project Overview

For this project, I used stock data to analyze and understabd the trends. To achieve the analysis, I used VBA which is often the program used to analyze data in the financial industry.

To start, I looked at how actively DQ was traded in 2018. This will help determine whether a stock that is traded often, will accurately reflect the value of the stock. 

1. First, sum up all of the daily volume for DQ, and it will lead to the yearly volume and a rough idea of how often it gets traded.

2. To calculate the total daily volume in 2018 use loops, which is a process of iterating through a dataset repeatedly.

# Challenge
Created an analysis for the stock market for Steve to compare stocks and inform his parents which one is the best option.
The analysis is refactored using 4 different loops in order to allow for multiple stock analysis.
