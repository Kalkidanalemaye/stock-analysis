# Project Overview

For this project, I used stock data to analyze and understabd the trends. To achieve the analysis, I used VBA which is often the program used to analyze data in the financial industry.

# Challenge
Created an analysis for the stock market for Steve to compare stocks and inform his parents which one is the best option.
The analysis is refactored using 4 different loops in order to allow for multiple stock analysis.
